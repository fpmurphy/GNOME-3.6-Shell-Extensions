Notice To Packagers
-------------------

If you repackage this extension, you must retain my copyright
notice. You are also responsible for maintaining the package 
- not me.


Purpose
-------

Display current weather conditions and five day forecast.


Installation
------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called weather@fpmurphy.com
should be created. For global use, install the tarball in
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions and unpack.

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the
extension using my gnome-extension-tool:

    gnome-extension-tool -e weather@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

    gnome-extension-tool -d weather@fpmurphy.com

See 

    gnome-extension-tool --help

for more information.

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension.

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadata.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.

This extension accesses weather data from World Weather Online

     http://www.worldweatheronline.com/

To use this extension, you must sign up and get a free API key
from World Weather Online.  Sign up is simple and painless.

Once you have an API key, you can configure the extension by right
clicking on the weather icon and entering the API key and location.
Location can either be a string such as TOKYO, DUBLIN, IRELAND, or a 
zipcode such as 01960.

Alternatively you can use the command line weather-tool (which 
comes with the extension) to customize the extension via DBus. 
See

    weather-tool --help

for more information.

Notes
-----

This version of the extension does NOT work on versions of
the GNOME Shell < 3.6.

This version supports localized message strings. However
message catalogues are not supplied.

This version has only been tested on Fedora 18 Beta and GNOME 
Shell 3.6.

As of the date of the latest version of this extension, there are
no officially published APIs for the GNOME Shell. This extension
relies on an internal structures which may or may not be present
in future versions of the GNOME Shell.
