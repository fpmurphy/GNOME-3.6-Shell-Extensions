Notice To Packagers
-------------------

If you repackage this extension, you must retain my copyright
notice. You are also responsible for maintaining the package -
not me.


Purpose:
--------

Change the day of the week that the calendar tool starts on.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called startofweek@fpmurphy.com
should be created.  For use by all users, install in
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions.

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the
extension using:

     gnome-extension-tool -e startofweek@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-extension-tool -d startofweek@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool, gsettings, dconf-editor,
etc. can also be used to enable or disable the extension.

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.

Configure the day of the week that you want the calendar to
start on by editing the constant START_OF_WEEK.  In locales
where Sunday is the first day of the week, START_OF_WEEK will
typically be set to 1. If you want the calendar to display 
Monday as the start of week, set START_OF_WEEK to 2.  If you
want the calendar to display Tuesday as the start of the week,
set START_OF_WEEK to 3, and so on ....


Version:
--------

V3.6.0    11/19/2012    Port to GNOME 3.6
V2.0      11/22/2011    Port to GNOME 3.2
V1.0       6/03/2011    Initial version for GNOME 3.0



Notes:
------

This version of the extension does NOT work on versions of
the GNOME Shell < 3.6.

This has only been tested on Fedora 18 Beta and GNOME Shell 3.6.

As of the date of the latest version of this extension, there are
no officially published APIs for the GNOME Shell. This extension
relies on internal structures and variables which may or may
not be present in future versions of the GNOME Shell.


Thanks
------

Thanks to Aleksander Zdyb who did an initial port to GNOME 3.2.
