Notice To Packagers
-------------------

If you repackage this extension, you must retain my copyright
notice. You are also responsible for maintaining the package -
not me.


Purpose
-------

Remove the username on top panel right hand side.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called removeusername@fpmurphy.com
should be created. For global use, install the tarball in
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions and unpack.

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using: 

     gnome-extension-tool -e removeusername@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-extension-tool -d removeusername@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Version:
--------

V3.6.0   10/25/2012   Ported to GNOME Shell 3.6


Notes:
------

This version of the extension may NOT work on versions of 
the GNOME Shell < 3.6.

This has only been tested on Fedora 18 Beta and GNOME Shell 3.6

As of the date of the latest version of this extension, there are 
no officially published APIs for the GNOME Shell. This extension 
relies on an internal structures which may or may not be present 
in future versions of the GNOME Shell.
