Notice To Packagers
-------------------

If you repackage this extension, you must retain my copyright
notice. You are also responsible for maintaining the package - not me.   


Version
-------

v3.6   18/11/2012     Updated to work under GNOME 3.6


Purpose
-------

Install a button in top panel status area to toggle the Looking
Glass (the GNOME Shell "debugger") display on or off.


Installation
------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called lookingglassbutton@fpmurphy.com
should be created. 

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using my gnome-extension-tool: 

     gnome-extension-tool -e lookingglassbutton@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-extension-tool -d lookingglassbutton@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.
